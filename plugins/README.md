## Adding a new plugin

Create a directory under `plugins/` with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. The parent repo's `marketplace.json` registers it under the `amans-plugins` marketplace name.

See the [plugin-dev docs](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) or run `/create-plugin` for scaffolding.
